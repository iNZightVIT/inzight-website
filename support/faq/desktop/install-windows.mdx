## I'm getting an "Untrusted Software" warning from my browser when I try to download iNZight

Since we haven't paid money to Microsoft or Apple to sign the installers, your browser may warn you not to trust them. Depending on your browser, you should be able to override this security setting and "allow the download to proceed".

- **Chrome**: click the down-arrow to the right of the download (at the bottom of the screen) and click "Proceed with the download"

## Windows wont let me run the installer due to security issues

If you are not an admin user, Windows might not let you run the installer if you open it directly from your web browser.

- Navigate to your Downloads folder
- Double-click the iNZightVIT Windows Installer

The reason for this is because we haven't paid Microsoft to give us a license, so iNZight isn't listed as 'safe'. So long as you download from this website, there shouldn't be any problems.

## I can't get iNZight to run

If iNZight seems to have installed properly but will not run it may be because you are using an institutionally-owned computer with security settings which are preventing iNZight from running.

- Sometimes in this case the security settings will still allow iNZight to run from a memory stick. To try this out, either install onto the stick or copy the INZightVIT folder from wherever you have installed it onto the stick. To start, go inside the iNZight VIT folder and click the iNZight shortcut. (Desktop shortcuts may not work as the drive letter for the disk is not the same every time you insert it.)
- Otherwise you will need to involve someone with administrator privileges to install iNZightVIT inside Program Files.

## I've started iNZight and the window is too big for me to see it all

_Temporary fixes_:

- Drag the top of the window until you see one of the top corners and use that to shrink the window
- Or, drag the top of the window until you see the maximize box and maximize it

_Permanent Fix_:

- Go File > Preferences and reset the window size to something smaller, Save (bottom of the preferences window). Then go File > Exit.
- Next time you start up iNZight it will have the smaller window size.
