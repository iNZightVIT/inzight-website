import TOCInline from "@theme/TOCInline";

<TOCInline toc={toc} />

:::note

iNZight expects spreadsheet-like data in which the first row of cells contain the _names of variables_ and everything in the column beneach a variable name is data recorded on that variable.

Attempting to import invalid data will result in an error.

## Lite disconnects when I load data on a Mac

If you try to import a dataset that iNZight Lite cannot read, it may disconnect. A common issue among macOS users is trying to import a `.numbers` file instead of a `.csv`. iNZight cannot read `.numbers` files, so you must import the `.csv`.

Within macOS Numbers, you can save/export the file as a CSV file by

- opening the **File menu** > **Export to** > **CSV**
- open **Advanced Options** and be sure to _check UTF-8 as the Text Encoding_
- click **Next**, and _choose a location to save the file_
- finally, click **Export**
