# Code Panel

The Code Panel in iNZight Lite shows you the R code that corresponds to your actions in the application. This allows you to:

- **Learn R**: See the R code equivalent of point-and-click actions
- **Reproduce analyses**: Copy code to run in your own R environment
- **Extend work**: Use the generated code as a starting point for more advanced analyses

## Accessing the Code Panel

1. Select **Code** from the module dropdown menu in iNZight Lite
2. The panel displays the accumulated R code from your session

## What Code is Generated

iNZight Lite generates code for many (but not all) operations:

### Currently Supported

- Data import operations
- Variable manipulations (rename, recode, transform)
- Basic visualizations
- Summary statistics
- Model fitting

### Not Yet Supported

Some panels may not generate code. The Code Panel will note which operations are supported and which are still being developed.

## Using the Generated Code

### Viewing Code

The code is displayed in a text panel that shows:

1. **Package requirements**: A list of R packages needed to run the code
2. **Setup code**: Instructions for installing required packages
3. **Your operations**: The R code matching your actions in Lite

### Copying Code

To use the code in R:

1. Copy the code from the text display
2. Paste it into your R console or script file
3. Modify the file paths as needed (Lite cannot access your local directories)

:::note
Since iNZight Lite runs in your browser, file paths in the generated code will need to be updated to point to files on your local computer.
:::

## Example

After loading a dataset and creating a plot, the Code Panel might show:

```r
# iNZight Code History

## This script was automatically generated by iNZight Lite

library(magrittr)  # enables the pipe (%>%) operator
library(iNZightPlots)

# Import data
data <- read.csv("your_data.csv")

# Create plot
iNZightPlot(height, weight, data = data)
```

## Tips

- **Check periodically**: View the Code Panel after completing major steps to see how they translate to R code
- **Note the packages**: Make sure you have the required packages installed before running the code
- **Customize paths**: Update file paths to match your local directory structure
- **Use as a learning tool**: Compare your code to iNZight's approach to learn different R techniques

## Troubleshooting

### "No code to show"

This appears when:
- No data has been loaded yet
- Only unsupported operations have been performed

Load a dataset and perform some visualizations to generate code.

### Code doesn't run in R

- Ensure all required packages are installed
- Update file paths to your local files
- Check for any missing variables or data
