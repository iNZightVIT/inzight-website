# About iNZight

iNZight was initially designed for New Zealand high schools, allowing students to quickly and easily explore data and understand some statistical ideas (using the companion program VIT). Since then, it has grown into a powerful tool used by researchers, government agencies, and educators around the world.

The project was founded by [Professor Chris Wild](https://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~wild/) from the [Department of Statistics](https://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz) at the University of Auckland, and is currently led by [Dr Tom Elliott](https://tomelliott.co.nz).

## Privacy

iNZight is completely free to use, and we respect your privacy. We do not collect any personal information, although we do track **anonymously** where our users are from (city, country), what version of iNZight they use, and what operating system they are running.

### Why collect information?

Knowing what versions our users are using, and their operating systems and locations, helps us make better decisions about where to take iNZight in the future.

### Opting out

If you prefer not to share this information, you can easily disable it by opening iNZight, clicking **File** > **Preferences**, and deselecting the box next to **Allow iNZight to collect anonymous usage information**.

In the latest version of iNZight, we ask you if you would like to share information when you first start the application. If you decline, we will collect **absolutely no information from you whatsoever**.
