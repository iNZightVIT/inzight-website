# Development of iNZight

iNZight is a student-driven project, so most of the big-scale changes occur over the (New Zealand) summer period. At other times, we mostly work on small changes and bug fixes.

## Source Code

All of our work is kept on [GitHub](https://github.com/iNZightVIT). If you are interested in following iNZight's development or contributing, that's the place to start.

## Installing Development Versions

Using the `devtools` package in R, you can download the latest developmental version of iNZight and try it out without waiting for a packaged release version.

```r
# Install devtools if you haven't already
install.packages("devtools")

# Install a development package
devtools::install_github("iNZightVIT/iNZight")
```

Replace `iNZight` with any of the iNZight packages:
- `iNZight` - Main GUI application
- `iNZightPlots` - Plotting functionality
- `iNZightTools` - Data manipulation tools
- `iNZightTS` - Time series module
- `iNZightMR` - Multiple response module
- `iNZightRegression` - Regression module
- `iNZightMaps` - Maps module

## Contributing

We welcome contributions! If you'd like to help:

1. **Report bugs** - Open an issue on the relevant [GitHub repository](https://github.com/iNZightVIT)
2. **Suggest features** - Let us know what you'd like to see via email or GitHub issues
3. **Submit code** - Fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request

## R Users

If you're an R user who wants to use iNZight's functionality programmatically, you can install the packages directly from our R repository:

```r
# Add the iNZight repository
options(repos = c(
  iNZight = "https://r.docker.stat.auckland.ac.nz/R",
  CRAN = "https://cloud.r-project.org"
))

# Install iNZight packages
install.packages("iNZight")
```

See the [Reference documentation](/docs/reference) for details on using the packages programmatically.
