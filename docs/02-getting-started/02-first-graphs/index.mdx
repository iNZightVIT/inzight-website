## Creating your first graph

import inzCasImg from "./inzight_cas.png";
import inzCasTravelImg from "./inzight_cas_travel.png";
import inzCasCellsourceLImg from "./inzight_cas_lite_cellsource.png";

<desktop>

Once the data is loaded, iNZight will display the spreadsheet in the left-hand panel of the main window, like this:

<Figure
  src={inzCasImg}
  caption="iNZight with the Census at School 500 data loaded"
  width="800"
/>

:::note

iNZight only displays a subset of rows at a time, and you can move up and down the dataset using the 'Up' and 'Down' buttons below the spreadsheet. If you want to load the full spreadsheet, **Dataset** > **View full dataset** will give you one in a new windows for you to explore.

:::

Now you're ready to create your first graph! The variable names at the top of the spreadsheet view are draggable---go ahead and try dragging **"travel"** onto the Variable 1 box underneath (labeled "Select/Drag-drop Variable 1"). Congratulations---you've created a **bar chart** of `travel`, which is exactly the best way of graphing this type of **_categorical_** variable!

<Figure src={inzCasTravelImg} caption="A bar chart of travel" width="800" />

</desktop>

<lite>

When you first open the **Visualize** screen, iNZight will automatically graph the first variable in the dataset for you. In this case, we are looking at a **bar chart** of `cellsource`.

<Figure

  caption="A bar chart of travel"
  width="800"
/>

</lite>

:::tip Categorical variables

These are variables that have distinct _categories_, _levels_, or _groups_. In the example above, the variable `travel` can take values such as "bike" or "bus". These might also be referred to as **factor** or **qualitative** variables.

Another way of choosing variables is to select them directly from the **Select
variable** dropdown. For example, click the first variable box (currently
labeled `travel`) and choose `height` from the dropdown.

</desktop>

<lite>

To graph another variable, simply click the dropdown box under **Select first
variable:** and choose another variable, for example `height`.

</lite>

You will now see a **dot plot** in which all of the 500 students' heights are "dropped" onto the graph and allowed to stack if they land on top of an existing point. This is a great way of looking at **numeric variables** to see how the values are distributed.

import inzCasHeightImg from "./inzight_cas_height.png";
import inzCasHeightImgL from "./inzight_cas_height_lite.png";

<Figure
  src={{ desktop: inzCasHeightImg, lite: inzCasHeightImgL }}
  caption="A dot plot of height"
  width="800"
/>

:::tip Numeric variables

These are variables that have values which can be _measured_ or _counted_. In the example above, the variable `height` can take any positive value as measured using a ruler. These might also be referred to as **continuous** or **quantitative** variables.

If you get confused between **quantitative** and **qualitative** variables, just remember qua**n**titative variables are **n**umbers!

:::

## Now it's your turn!

Create some graphs of different variables (just using Variable 1 for now) and think about what you're seeing: is the variable **categorical** or **numeric**? Can you find anything interesting? You could try answering these questions:

1. What is the most popular way students in this sample get their lunch?<br/>
   _Hint: the variable called `getlunch` tells us where each student gets their lunch from._
2. Some students spend more on their monthly phone bills than others: what was the most a student spends, on average?<br/>
   _Hint: students monthly spends are contained in a variable called `cellcost`._
3. What is the most common age of students in the sample?
4. When it comes to mode of `travel`, do more students walk to school or catch the bus (or is it too hard to tell)?
