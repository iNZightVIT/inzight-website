title: The Data Panel
description: The data panel is where users can switch between various datasets, view the spreadsheet or variables, and search for variables.

Situated in the top-left quadrant of the interface, the data panel primarily displays the active data, either as a spreadsheet or a list of variables. Above this are several buttons for switching between views, viewing information about the dataset, and searching for variables. The dropdown at the top lets users switch between documents (both imported and created by actions from the [dataset](../menubar/dataset) menu).

## Dataset selection box

As you explore your dataset, you may experiment with actions from the dataset menu. Most of these actions perform large-scale changes on your data, which may not always go as planned. iNZight creates a _new_ dataset each time, and appends a suffix to the dataset's name. The **dataset selection box** provides a list of all the datasets created so far, and allows users to switch between them.

## Dataset toolbar

import dataToolbar from "./data_toolbar.png"

Below the dataset selection box is a row of buttons. The two left-most of these allow users to switch between **spreadsheet** and **variable** view. The third button opens a new window with a general overview summary of the dataset, and the fourth button opens a search box.

import ToolbarTable from "./ToolbarTable"

## Pagination

The spreadsheet view provides a rectangular view of every value in your dataset. However, some datasets might have lots of rows or columns (or both!) so iNZight uses pagination. This ensures that the software can quickly load the interface, without restricting what you can see (in previous verisons of iNZight, the spreadsheet view was disable for large datasets).

Use the pagination controls (columns are controlled at the top; rows at the bottom) to navigate through your dataset. Remember, you can also use the search functionality to find specific columns/variables.
