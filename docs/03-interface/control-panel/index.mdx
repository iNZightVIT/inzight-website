---

The control panel is the main interface for selecting variables to explore. There are four drop-down boxes: two for main plotting variables and two for subsetting.

## Variable 1: the primary variable of interest

The first drop-down box allows you to specify the _Primary Variable of Interest_. This is required for all plots.

- Main variable
- Response
- Outcome

## Variable 2: secondary variable

The second drop-down box allows you to specify a secondary variable. This is optional, and will produce a new plot depending on the types of both variables 1 and 2.

## Variable 3: subsetting/faceting variable

The third drop-down allows you to subset, or facet, the plot. This will not affect the typo of plot displayed.

## Variable 4: filtering variable

The final drop-down box allows you to filter the data. By default, no change will occur until you move the slider.

## Variable controls

### Switch

The down arrow allows you to quickly swith the variable on that row with the one below it.

### Clear

The cross to the right of each drop-down clears that variable.

## Get Summary

The **Get Summary** button opens up a new window that presents a basic statistical summary of the data in the current plot.

## Get Inference

The **Get Inference** button opens up a new window allowing users to generate simple statistical inferences of the data, for example confidence intervals for basic statistics or hypothesis tests. The range of options available depends on the types of variables selected.
