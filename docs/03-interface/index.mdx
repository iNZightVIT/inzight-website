The iNZight GUI, shown below, can be divided into several different _sections_. In this section, we will go over each describing its importance.

While using iNZight, if you come across something you are unsure about, you can use the following pages to track down the relevant documentation. Note in many cases iNZight includes a help button which will take you directly to the relevant page.
