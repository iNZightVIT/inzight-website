title: Standardise
description: Standardise a numeric variable.
---

Create a **standardised** version of a variable (or **z-score**) by subtracting the mean of the variable from each value and dividing by its standard deviation. The new variable will have a mean of zero and variance of one.

Go to **Variables** > **Numeric Variables** > **Standardise**.

Select one or more numeric variables and click **Standardise**. A new variable is added to the dataset for each selected variable, with the suffix `.std` (e.g., `height.std`).

Standardisation is useful for comparing variables measured on different scales, as it puts them onto a common scale where a value of 1 means "one standard deviation above the mean".
