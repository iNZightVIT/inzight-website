title: Form Class Intervals
description: Convert a numeric variable into a set of ordered categories.
---

Create a categorical variable whose levels are class intervals of a numeric variable.
For example, take `age` and create `age.f` with levels `{"{0,20]", "(20,60]", "(60,110]"}`.

Go to **Variables** > **Numeric Variables** > **Form class intervals**.

## Options

- **Variable**: Select the numeric variable to convert.
- **Number of intervals**: Choose how many intervals to divide the variable into.
- **Method**: Select how the intervals are determined:
  - **Equal width**: All intervals have the same range (e.g., 0–20, 20–40, 40–60).
  - **Equal count**: Each interval contains approximately the same number of observations.
  - **Specified**: Manually define the breakpoints between intervals.
- **Format**: Choose whether intervals are displayed as `(open, closed]` or `[closed, open)`.
- **Custom labels**: Optionally provide descriptive names for each interval (e.g., "young", "middle-aged", "senior") instead of the numeric ranges.

The new categorical variable is added to the dataset alongside the original numeric variable.
