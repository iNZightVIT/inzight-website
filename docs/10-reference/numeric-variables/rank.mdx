title: Rank
description: Rank the values of a numeric variable.
---

Creates a new numeric variable containing the _rank_, or _order_ of the selected variable.
This is often used when the order of the values (but not the values themselves) is of interest.

For example,

| age | age_rank |
| :-- | :------- |
| 15  | 2        |
| 12  | 1        |
| 19  | 4        |
| 16  | 3        |
