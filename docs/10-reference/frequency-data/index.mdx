iNZight allows users to work with frequency data, either in cases where a column contains counts/frequencies, or where the data is stored in a frequency table.

To specify frequency information, use the **Dataset** > **Frequency tables** menu.

import freq from "./freqtables.png";
import freqLite from "./freqtables_lite.png";

<Figure

/>

## Expand Table

The **expand table** option can be used to work with both numeric and categorical variables. The storage and efficiency savings of working with a unique combinations of variables plus frequencies will typically be very much smaller here.

## Specify Frequency Column

When a **frequency column** is specified, graphics and summaries respond to a combinations-of-variables-plus-their-frequencies data structure. Only categorical variables are retained.

## Remove Frequency Column

This option removes the frequency column and iNZight works with the original data.
