title: Collapse levels
description: Collapse levels of a categorical variable.
---

Combine levels within a categorical parent variable to make a new variable with a smaller number of levels. (The levels of a categorical variable are the set of unique, or distinct, values it takes.)

Go to **Variables** > **Categorical Variables** > **Collapse levels**.

1. Select a **categorical variable** from the dropdown.
2. Select **two or more levels** to combine into a single level.
3. Provide a **name** for the new combined level.
4. Click **Collapse** to create the new variable.

The original variable is kept and a new variable with the collapsed levels is added to the dataset. If only one level is selected, the variable remains unchanged.
