title: Rename Levels
description: Rename levels/categories of a categorical variable.
---

Change the names of the levels of a categorical variable, e.g. from (ages) `{"< 12", "12-17", "18-69", "> 69"}` to `{"child", "adolescent", "adult", "elder"}`.

Go to **Variables** > **Categorical Variables** > **Rename levels**.

1. Select a **categorical variable** from the dropdown.
2. A text field appears for each level of the variable, pre-filled with the current name.
3. Type the **new name** in any field you want to change.
4. Click **Rename** to apply the changes.

Fields left unchanged or empty keep the original level name.
