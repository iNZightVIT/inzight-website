description: Create new variables from existing ones.
---

A very flexible facility for creating new variables from existing variables, essentially by doing arithmetic on them.

import createNew from "./create_new_var.png";

_Left-hand box_: desired name for new variable
_Right-hand box_: any valid **R** expression

Examples

- `income = hours * payrate`
- `weight.diff = end.weight - begin.weight`
- `average.weight = ( begin.weight + endweight) / 2`
