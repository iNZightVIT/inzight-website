title: Generate Data Report
description: Automatically generate a data quality report for your dataset.
---

The **Generate Data Report** feature produces an automated data quality report for your current dataset. The report summarises each variable, highlighting potential issues such as unusual distributions, outliers, and missing values.

Access via **Dataset** > **Generate data report**.

:::note Requirements
This feature requires the `dataMaid`, `rmarkdown`, and `pandoc` packages/tools to be installed. If they are not available, the menu item will not appear.

## Report Formats

Choose from three output formats:

| Format | Description |
|---|---|
| **PDF** | Portable document, suitable for printing and sharing |
| **Word Document** | Editable Microsoft Word document (.docx) |
| **HTML** | Web page, opens in your default browser |

## What's in the Report

The report is generated by the [`dataMaid`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=dataMaid) R package and includes, for each variable:

- **Variable class and type** (numeric, factor, character, etc.)
- **Summary statistics** (mean, median, range for numeric; frequency table for categorical)
- **Distribution visualisations** (histograms, bar charts)
- **Potential problems** flagged automatically, such as:
  - Variables with very few unique values
  - Variables with many missing values
  - Possible outliers or unusual values
  - Unexpected coding patterns

## How to Use

1. Load your dataset
2. Go to **Dataset** > **Generate data report**
3. Select the output format
4. Click **Generate**
5. The report will be created and opened automatically

The report is saved to a temporary location. To keep it, save or copy it from the location shown after generation.

## Tips

- Use this as a **first step** when working with a new dataset to quickly identify data quality issues
- The flagged problems are suggestions — not all flags necessarily indicate real issues
- For large datasets, report generation may take a few moments
