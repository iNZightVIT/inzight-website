title: Filtering
description: Filter by value, condition, row number, or randomly.
---

This tool provides several methods for filtering the dataset.
The window that opens has four options for you to choose from:

- [Levels of a categorical variable](#levels-of-a-categorical-variable)
- [Numeric condition](#numeric-condition)
- [Row number](#row-number)
- [Randomly](#randomly)

import filterImg from "./1_filter.png";
import filterLImg from "./1_filter_lite.png";

### Levels of a categorical variable

import filterLevelsImg from "./2_filter_levels.png";
import filterLevelsLImg from "./2_filter_levels_lite.png";

<Figure
  src={{ desktop: filterLevelsImg, lite: filterLevelsLImg }}
  caption="Filter by categorical levels"
  width={{ desktop: 300, lite: 500 }}
/>

After selecting a categorical variable from the drop down box, you can select which levels you want **_to keep_** in the data set.

### Numeric condition

import filterNumericImg from "./3_filter_numeric.png";
import filterNumericLImg from "./3_filter_numeric_lite.png";

<Figure
  src={{ desktop: filterNumericImg, lite: filterNumericLImg }}
  caption="Filter by numeric condition"
  width={350}
/>

This allows you to define a condition with which to filter your data. For example, you could include only the observations of `height` over 180 cm by

1. selecting `height` from the drop down menu,
2. clicking on the `>` symbol, and
3. entering the value `180` in the third box.

### Row number

import filterRowsImg from "./4_filter_rows.png";
import filterRowsLImg from "./4_filter_rows_lite.png";

<Figure
  src={{ desktop: filterRowsImg, lite: filterRowsLImg }}
  caption="Filter by row number"
  width={{ desktop: 300, lite: 350 }}
/>

Exclude a range of row numbers as follows:

- Entering 101:1000 (and then **Submit**) will exclude all rows from 101 to 1000
- Similarly, 1, 5, 99, 101:1000 will exclude rows 1, 5, 99, and everything from 101 to 1000

### Randomly

import filterRandomImg from "./5_filter_random.png";
import filterRandomLImg from "./5_filter_random_lite.png";

<Figure
  src={{ desktop: filterRandomImg, lite: filterRandomLImg }}
  caption="Filter randomly"
  width={{ desktop: 200, lite: 350 }}
/>

Essentially, this allows you to perform bootstrap randomisation manually.
The current behaviour is this:

- "Sample Size", _n_, is the number of observations to draw for each sample,
- "Number of Samples", _m_, is the number of samples to create in the new data set.
- The output will be a data set with _n_ x _m_ rows, which _must be smaller than the total number of rows in the data set_.
- The observations are drawn randomly _without replacement_ from the data set.
