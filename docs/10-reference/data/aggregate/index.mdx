description: Obtain summaries of numeric variables for combinations of categorical variables.

This function essentially allows you to obtain "summaries" of all of the numeric variables in the data set for combinations of categorical variables.

- _Variables_: if only one variable is specified, the new data set will have one row for each level of the variable.
  If two (or more) are specified, then there will be one row for each combination.
  For example, the categorical variables `gender = {male, female}` and `ethnicity = {white, black, asian, other}` will result in a data set with 2x4 rows.
- _Summaries_: each row will have the chosen summaries given for each numeric variable in the data set.
  For example, if the data set has the variables `gender (cat)` and `height (num)`, and if the user selects `Mean` and `Sd`,
  then the new data set will have the columns `gender`, `height.Mean` and `height.Sd`.
  In the rows, the values will be _for that combination of categorical variables_;
  the row for `gender = female` will have the mean height _of the females_, and the standard deviation of height _for the females_.

  A visual example of this would be do drag `height` into the Variable 1 slot, and `gender` into the Variable 2 slot.
  Clicking on "Get Summary" would provide the same information. The advantage of using Aggregate is that the summaries are calculated _for every numeric variable in the data set_, not just one of them.
