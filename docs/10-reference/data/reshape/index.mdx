description: Reshape datasets between long and wide formats.

There are two common ways for a dataset to be structured.

**Long format** is where each row represents a single observation and each column represents a variable. This is the most common format for datasets, and is preferred for use in iNZight and R.

**Wide format** is where each row represents a single individual with observations in columns.

To reshape a dataset, go to **Datasets** and choose **Reshape dataset**.

import reshape from "./reshape.png";
import reshapeLite from "./reshape_lite.png";

## Wide to long

import reshapeW2L from "./reshape_wide_to_long.png";
import reshapeW2LLite from "./reshape_wide_to_long_lite.png";

This allows you to select a column or multiple columns from your dataset.

- One new column (default name `key`) is populated by the column name(s) of the selected column(s)
- The other new column (default name `value`) will contain the column value from the selected columns.
- The selected column(s) will be removed and two new columns will be added to the dataset.
- A preview panel shows what the new dataset will look like.

## Long to wide

import reshapeL2W from "./reshape_long_to_wide.png";
import reshapeL2WLite from "./reshape_long_to_wide_lite.png";

You can select a column to spread out into multiple columns (the column is named `key` in the example).
It will use the column values of the selected column as a set of names for new columns.

You then select another column with corresponding values to be put into the new columns (the column is named `value` in the example).
