- The ordering will be nested, so that the data is first ordered by "Variable 1", and then "Variable 2", etc.
- For categorical variables, the ordering will be based on the order of the variable (by default, this will be alphabetical unless manually changed in "Manipulate Variables" > "Categorical Variables" > "Reorder Levels").
