Rename variables (columns) in the dataset. Especially useful for variables created by iNZight that may have automatically generated names.

Go to **Variables** > **Rename variables**.

A text field is shown for each variable in the dataset, pre-filled with the current name. Type a new name in any field you want to change, then click **Rename** to apply. Unchanged fields keep the original name.
