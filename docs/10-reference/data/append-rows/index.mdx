description: Append new rows to a dataset with matching columns.

Adds to the bottom of the original dataset rows from a newly imported dataset (imported using the Import facility provided).

import appendRows from "./append_rows.png";
import appendRowsLite from "./append_rows_lite.png";

- The column names from both datasets are matched so the correct data goes into the correct columns
- Columns that appear in one dataset and not the other _will_ appear in the result
- An error will be reported and not appending will be possible if two column names match but their types (e.g. numeric or categorical) do not match
- If the Tick-box option is selected a timestamp variable called **When_Added** will be added to the dataset recording when the new observations were added
- If there is already a variable called **When_Added** present in the original data (must be of type date-time, `(t)` in View Variables) the new timestamps will be appended to that existing variable

:::tip

Where data is periodically being added to a dataset, this facility can be used to keep track of when each row was added --- thus facilitating analyses of the data as it was up until any particular time point.
