title: Missing to Categorical
description: Create explicit categories for missing values.
---

Often it is useful to be able to identify missing values in a dataset. iNZight includes capabilities to make these explicit. The behaviour of this tool depends on the type of variable.

## Categorical variables

Any missing observations for the variable we be given a new level, `missing`. All others remain the same.

## Numeric variables

The variable will be converted into a categorical variable with two levels: `missing` and `observed`.
