title: Missing to Categorical
description: Create explicit categories for missing values.
---

Often it is useful to be able to identify missing values in a dataset. iNZight includes capabilities to make these explicit. The behaviour of this tool depends on the type of variable.

Go to **Variables** > **Missing to categorical**. Select one or more variables, then click **Submit** to create the new columns.

## Categorical variables

Any missing observations for the variable will be given a new level, `missing`. All other values remain the same.

## Numeric variables

A new categorical variable is created with two levels: `missing` and `observed`. This is useful for investigating patterns of missingness — for example, you can use the new variable as a subsetting or colouring variable to see whether missing values are associated with other variables in the dataset.
