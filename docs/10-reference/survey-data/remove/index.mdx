You can remove a survey design specification from your dataset to return to analysing the data as a simple random sample.

## Removing a Survey Design

To remove the survey design:

1. Go to **Dataset** → **Survey design** → **Remove design**
2. Confirm the removal

After removing the design, iNZight will treat your data as if it came from a simple random sample. All analyses will use standard (non-survey) methods.

## When to Remove a Design

You might want to remove a survey design if:
- You want to compare survey-weighted results with unweighted results
- You accidentally specified the wrong design
- You want to analyse a subset of the data without the survey structure

:::warning
Analysing complex survey data without accounting for the survey design can lead to incorrect standard errors, confidence intervals, and p-values. Only remove the design if you understand the implications.
