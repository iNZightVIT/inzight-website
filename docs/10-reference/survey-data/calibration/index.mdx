Calibration (also known as post-stratification or raking) adjusts survey weights so that the weighted sample totals match known population totals. This can improve the precision of survey estimates.

## What is Calibration?

Calibration adjusts the sampling weights so that:
- Weighted totals for certain variables match known population values
- Survey estimates become more accurate by incorporating external information
- Non-response bias may be reduced

## When to Use Calibration

Use calibration when:
- You have reliable population totals for certain variables (e.g., from a census)
- You want to ensure your weighted estimates match known population margins
- You suspect non-response may have biased your sample

## Calibration in iNZight

After specifying a survey design, you can calibrate the weights:

1. Go to **Dataset** → **Survey design** → **Post-stratify/Rake/Calibrate...**
2. Select variables to calibrate on
3. Enter the known population totals
4. Click **OK** to apply calibration
