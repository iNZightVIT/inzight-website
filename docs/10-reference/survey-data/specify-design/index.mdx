desciption: Specify a complex survey design in iNZight
sidebar_position: 2
---

iNZight lets users specify complex survey designs in several ways. Under the hood, iNZight uses the [**survey**](http://r-survey.r-forge.r-project.org/survey/) R package.

The first is to manually specify information about the design, such as the strata, clusters, and weights, or by specifying replicate weights. While this is the simplest method, it does come with the risk of misspecification.

An alternative method is to use a _survey specification_ file. This allows users to set up a survey with one-click (either by importing the file directly, or loading the survey design information from it). If you are distributing a survey to use with iNZight, unless you are teaching a course about survey design and the design specification is an integral part, we recommend you distribute the data with a survey specification file. See [design specification files](surveyspec) for more information.

## Specify Design Information

import specifyDesign from "./specify_design.png";
import specifyDesignLite from "./specify_design_lite.png";

Specifying a survey design in terms of weighting, strata and clustering variables etc.

iNZightâ€™s survey methods cater for simple random sampling, stratified random sampling (random sampling within each population stratum), cluster sampling and multistage cluster sampling, and complex designs involving cluster sampling within population strata.

To specify the design, go to **Dataset** > **Survey design** > \*_Specify design ..._.

- **Strata variable:** If [stratified sampling](survey-notes.html#stratified) has been performed, use to select the variable that specifies which stratum each observation comes from. (This variable can be either numeric or categorical.)

- **1st stage clustering variable:** If [cluster sampling](survey-notes.html#cluster) has been performed, use to select the 1st-stage clustering variable; this specifies which [1st-stage cluster](survey-notes.html#multistage) each observation comes from. (Clustering variables can also be either numeric or categorical.)

- **2nd stage clustering variable:** If two or more stages of cluster sampling have been performed, use to select the 2nd-stage clustering variable (specifies which [2nd-stage cluster](survey-notes.html#multistage) each observation comes from). Any further levels of cluster sampling (3rd stage, etc., are not used)

- **Use nested sampling:** Quite often, compilers of survey data "reuse" cluster names from stratum to stratum. Let us take, as an example, a survey in which American states for the starts and counties form the clusters. Sampled counties from Washington State may be given a County value of 1, 2, ... and counties from Arizona may also be given a County value of 1, 2, ... Clearly County 1 from Washington refers to an entirely different county from County 1 from Arizona even though they have the same value of the County variable.

  **_Click_** the **Use nested sampling** check-box if cluster labels are being recycled/reused in the data.

- **Weighting variable:** If the sampling design used unequal probabilities of selection, use this to select a variable containing the **_sampling weight_** (1 over the probability of selection) for each observation. Certain estimates will be wrong if the sampling weights do not add up to the population size, in particular estimated _population_ or _subpopulation **totals**_ and estimated _population_ or _**sub**population sizes_. Sampling weights are often _adjusted_ to allow for _unit non-response_.

- **Finite population correction (fpc):** Use this when descriptive inferences are wanted about properties of the finite population being sampled and the sample size is an appreciable proportion of the population size (e.g. > 5 or 10%). If stratified sampling has not been used, this variable should contain an estimate of the size of the population being sampled, repeated for every observation. If stratified sampling has been used, the values of this variable should contain an estimate of the size of the population stratum being sampled (differing across strata but constant within each stratum).

  As an alternative to using population/stratum sizes, proportions _of the total population_ being sampled can be used.

  If _one stage cluster sampling has been used_ (where we take a random sample of clusters, and a census within clusters), the finite-population-correction selection-box should contain an estimate of the total number of clusters (the same on every row, or the same on every row within a stratum).

  _In two stage clustering_ we subsample within each selected cluster, and so we need to specify two variables: one for the number of clusters (just as in one stage clustering), and a second for the total number of units available for selection within each cluster (the same value on every row within the cluster). If the number of clusters is stored in a variable called **fpc1**, and the number of units within a cluster is stored in a variable called **fpc2**, then <Version desktop="type/paste __fpc1+fpc2__ in the finite population correction field" lite="select variables __fpc1__ and __fpc2__ in the 1st and 2nd finite-population-correction fields respectively"/>.

## Specifying Replicate Design Information

import replicateDesign from "./replicate_design.png";
import replicateDesignLite from "./replicate_design_lite.png";

Because making public factors like cluster membership can make it easier than survey agencies are comfortable with to identify individuals, many agencies do not distribute such information to outsiders. Instead they distribute sets of so-called _replicate weights_, slightly varying copies of the sampling weights variable that still enable survey analysis programs to make the proper adjustments to analyses of survey data.

**Left-hand panel**

- **Sampling Weights:** See variable selection box at the top-left

- **Replication weights incorporate sampling weights** (_checkbox_)**:** This should be **_checked if_** the replicate weights already include the sampling weights (which is usually the case). **_Uncheck this_** if the replicate weights are very different in size to the sampling weights.

- **Select replicate weights:** The large (lower) panel on the left-hand side displays the names of the variables in the dataset. Use to select the replicate-weights variables. In the example shown the replicate-weights variables were called _repw01_, _repw02_, _repw03_, ...

**Right-hand panel**

- **Type of replication weights:** Depends on the type of replicate weights the person who compiled the dataset has used. Select from list - _BRR_, _Fay_, _JK1_, _JKn_, _bootstrap_, _other_.

- **Overall scales:** Only used for Types _bootstrap_ and _other_.

## Calibrating Survey Data

This allows for **_poststratifying/raking/calibrating_** a design that has already been defined using either of the methods above above.

This allows a data-analyst to improve estimation by augmenting the information in the survey data by adding information on the whole population where this is available from other sources. Categorical variables in the data set are offered as possible poststratification/raking/calibration candidates. Corresponding population counts can be input by typing or reading from files.

To calibrate a survey, go to **Dataset** > **Survey design** > **Post stratify...**.

import calibrate from "./calibrate.png";
import calibrateLite from "./calibrate_lite.png";

<Figure
  src={{ desktop: calibrate, lite: calibrateLite }}
  caption="Post-stratification dialog"
  width={{ desktop: 400, lite: 600 }}
/>

In the example in the screenshot, there are 3 categorical variables in the data set offered as possible candidates and 2 have been selected. The design would then be calibrated using user-supplied information on population counts for the all the categories of both **admin_type** and **ethgp**.

This is fine when you only want to use information about single variables, but what if you have population information on the cross-classification (all possible combinations) of **admin_type** and **ethgp**, say? Then you would have to create a new variable in the dataset, called say **admin_type.ethgp** that has all these combinations. This can be done with **Variables > Categorical Variables > Combine categorical variables**.

:::warning

Currently the new variables have to be set up before specifying a survey design. If you only think about it later you will need to use **Remove design** (next item), set up new variables and then re-specify the design.

:::info

The design is updated using the [calibrate](http://r-survey.r-forge.r-project.org/survey/html/calibrate.html) function in R's survey package.
