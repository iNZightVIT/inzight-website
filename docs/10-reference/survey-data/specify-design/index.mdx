Specifying a survey design in terms of weighting, strata and clustering variables etc.

iNZightâ€™s survey methods cater for simple random sampling, stratified random sampling (random sampling within each population stratum), cluster sampling and multistage cluster sampling, and complex designs involving cluster sampling within population strata.

To specify the design, go to **Dataset** > **Survey design** > \*_Specify design ..._.

- **Strata variable:** If [stratified sampling](survey-notes.html#stratified) has been performed, use to select the variable that specifies which stratum each observation comes from. (This variable can be either numeric or categorical.)

- **1st stage clustering variable:** If [cluster sampling](survey-notes.html#cluster) has been performed, use to select the 1st-stage clustering variable; this specifies which [1st-stage cluster](survey-notes.html#multistage) each observation comes from. (Clustering variables can also be either numeric or categorical.)

- **2nd stage clustering variable:** If two or more stages of cluster sampling have been performed, use to select the 2nd-stage clustering variable (specifies which [2nd-stage cluster](survey-notes.html#multistage) each observation comes from). Any further levels of cluster sampling (3rd stage, etc., are not used)

- **Use nested sampling:** Quite often, compilers of survey data "reuse" cluster names from stratum to stratum. Let us take, as an example, a survey in which American states for the starts and counties form the clusters. Sampled counties from Washington State may be given a County value of 1, 2, ... and counties from Arizona may also be given a County value of 1, 2, ... Clearly County 1 from Washington refers to an entirely different county from County 1 from Arizona even though they have the same value of the County variable.

  **_Click_** the **Use nested sampling** check-box if cluster labels are being recycled/reused in the data.

- **Weighting variable:** If the sampling design used unequal probabilities of selection, use this to select a variable containing the **_sampling weight_** (1 over the probability of selection) for each observation. Certain estimates will be wrong if the sampling weights do not add up to the population size, in particular estimated _population_ or _subpopulation **totals**_ and estimated _population_ or _**sub**population sizes_. Sampling weights are often _adjusted_ to allow for _unit non-response_.

- **Finite population correction (fpc):** Use this when descriptive inferences are wanted about properties of the finite population being sampled and the sample size is an appreciable proportion of the population size (e.g. > 5 or 10%). If stratified sampling has not been used, this variable should contain an estimate of the size of the population being sampled, repeated for every observation. If stratified sampling has been used, the values of this variable should contain an estimate of the size of the population stratum being sampled (differing across strata but constant within each stratum).

  As an alternative to using population/stratum sizes, proportions _of the total population_ being sampled can be used.

  If _one stage cluster sampling has been used_ (where we take a random sample of clusters, and a census within clusters), the finite-population-correction selection-box should contain an estimate of the total number of clusters (the same on every row, or the same on every row within a stratum).

  _In two stage clustering_ we subsample within each selected cluster, and so we need to specify two variables: one for the number of clusters (just as in one stage clustering), and a second for the total number of units available for selection within each cluster (the same value on every row within the cluster). If the number of clusters is stored in a variable called **fpc1**, and the number of units within a cluster is stored in a variable called **fpc2**, then <Version desktop="type/paste __fpc1+fpc2__ in the finite population correction field" lite="select variables __fpc1__ and __fpc2__ in the 1st and 2nd finite-population-correction fields respectively"/>.
