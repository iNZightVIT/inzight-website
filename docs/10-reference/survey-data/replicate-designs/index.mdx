Because making public factors like cluster membership can make it easier than survey agencies are comfortable with to identify individuals, many agencies do not distribute such information to outsiders. Instead they distribute sets of so-called _replicate weights_, slightly varying copies of the sampling weights variable that still enable survey analysis programs to make the proper adjustments to analyses of survey data.

**Left-hand panel**

- **Sampling Weights:** See variable selection box at the top-left

- **Replication weights incorporate sampling weights** (_checkbox_)**:** This should be **_checked if_** the replicate weights already include the sampling weights (which is usually the case). **_Uncheck this_** if the replicate weights are very different in size to the sampling weights.

- **Select replicate weights:** The large (lower) panel on the left-hand side displays the names of the variables in the dataset. Use to select the replicate-weights variables. In the example shown the replicate-weights variables were called _repw01_, _repw02_, _repw03_, ...

**Right-hand panel**

- **Type of replication weights:** Depends on the type of replicate weights the person who compiled the dataset has used. Select from list - _BRR_, _Fay_, _JK1_, _JKn_, _bootstrap_, _other_.

- **Overall scales:** Only used for Types _bootstrap_ and _other_.
