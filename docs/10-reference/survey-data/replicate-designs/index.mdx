Replicate weight designs are an alternative way to specify a survey design when your dataset contains replicate weight variables instead of (or in addition to) design specification variables.

## What are Replicate Weights?

Replicate weights are a set of alternative sampling weights created by resampling methods. They allow variance estimation without needing to know the full details of the survey design structure. Common types include:

- **Jackknife (JK1, JKn)** - Leave-one-out resampling
- **Bootstrap** - Resampling with replacement  
- **Balanced Repeated Replication (BRR)** - For stratified designs with two PSUs per stratum
- **Fay's method** - A modification of BRR

## When to Use Replicate Weights

Use replicate weights when:
- Your dataset provider has supplied replicate weight variables
- The full design specification is not available
- The dataset documentation recommends using replicate weights

## Specifying a Replicate Design in iNZight

1. Go to **Dataset** → **Survey design** → **Specify design...**
2. Select **Replicate weights** design type
3. Choose the replicate weight variables from your dataset
4. Specify the type of replication method used
5. Click **OK** to apply the design
