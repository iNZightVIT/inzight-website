A **data dictionary** is a structured file that describes your dataset's variables — their names, types, descriptions, units, and coded values. In iNZight, you can load a data dictionary to automatically label and recode variables, making your data easier to understand and work with.

Access via **Dataset** > **Data Dictionary**.

## Loading a Data Dictionary

Go to **Dataset** > **Data Dictionary** > **Load** to open the data dictionary loader.

### File Format

The data dictionary should be a **CSV** or **Excel** file with one row per variable. The columns in the dictionary file are mapped to the following fields:

| Field | Description | Required? |
|---|---|---|
| **Variable name** | The name of the variable as it appears in the dataset | Yes |
| **Type** | The variable type (e.g., numeric, categorical) | No |
| **Title** | A human-readable label for the variable | No |
| **Description** | A longer description of what the variable measures | No |
| **Units** | The measurement units (e.g., cm, kg, $) | No |
| **Codes** | Coded values used in the data (e.g., 1, 2, 3) | No |
| **Values** | Labels for the coded values (e.g., Male, Female, Other) | No |

iNZight will attempt to auto-detect the column mappings based on common names (`type`, `title`, `description`, `units`, `codes`, `values`). If your columns have different names, use the dropdown menus to map each field manually.

### Separator

If the codes and values columns contain multiple entries per row (e.g., `1;2;3` for codes and `Male;Female;Other` for values), specify the **separator** character used to split them (default: `;`).

### Preview

After selecting a dictionary file and mapping the columns, a preview of the parsed dictionary is displayed at the bottom of the dialog. Check this to ensure the variable names, codes, and values are correctly interpreted.

### Apply Options

- **Apply dictionary to current dataset**: When checked (default), the dictionary is immediately applied to the active dataset — renaming variables, converting types, and recoding values according to the dictionary.
- **Apply to all loaded datasets**: When checked, the dictionary is applied to every currently loaded dataset, not just the active one.

Click **Load** to import the dictionary.

## Viewing a Data Dictionary

Go to **Dataset** > **Data Dictionary** > **View** to open a read-only view of the data dictionary attached to the current dataset.

The view displays a searchable table with all dictionary information:

- Use the **Search** box to filter variables by name or description
- Toggle **Case sensitive** for exact matching
- Click **Clear** to reset the search

This is useful for quickly looking up variable definitions, coded values, and descriptions while exploring the data.

## Example Dictionary

A minimal data dictionary CSV might look like:

```csv
name,type,title,description,codes,values
age,numeric,Age,Age in years at time of survey,,
gender,categorical,Gender,Self-reported gender,1;2;3,Male;Female;Other
height,numeric,Height (cm),Standing height in centimetres,,
travel,categorical,Travel Method,How the student travels to school,,
```

When applied, this would:
- Add labels and descriptions to the `age`, `gender`, `height`, and `travel` variables
- Recode `gender` from `1;2;3` to `Male;Female;Other`
