import { Desktop, Lite } from "@site/src/components/VersionToggle/inzVersion";

Once you're familiar with the basics of iNZight, you can try out some of the more advanced features.

<Desktop>

## iNZight Display Mode

iNZight (> 3.0) has two display modes: the traditional all-in-one window, as well as a separate graphics window and a narrow control panel (like VIT).

import singleWindow from "./1_inzight_home.png";
import dualWindow from "./8_inzight_dual_window.png";

<div style={{display: 'flex', gap: '1rem', flexWrap: 'wrap', justifyContent: 'center'}}>
  <img src={singleWindow} alt="iNZight Home - single window" style={{maxWidth: '400px'}} />
  <img src={dualWindow} alt="iNZight Home - dual window" style={{maxWidth: '400px'}} />
</div>

To switch between the two, go to **File** > **Preferences**, and check the box **"Use dual-window display mode"**.

</Desktop>

## Colour Specification

In many of the Colour specification windows, you can either select from the menu, or type in a value of your own. Colours can specified by the name of [any colour known by R](http://research.stowers-institute.org/efg/R/Color/Chart/ColorChart.pdf), or alternatively by using hexadecimal (HEX) codes.

To specify a HEX code, you enter a hash "#" followed by 6 digits (numbers 0-9 and/or letters A-F).
The 6-digit HEX code is divided into three 2-digit codes that specify red, green, and blue, respectively. 00 corresponds to 0%, and FF corresponds to 100%. Some examples are:

- `#000000` = black
- `#FFFFFF` = white
- <span style={{color: '#0000CC'}}>#0000CC</span> <span style={{color: '#009900'}}>#009900</span> <span style={{color: '#FF0000'}}>#FF0000</span> <span style={{color: '#c09030'}}>#c09040</span>

### Opacity

You can also specify opacity when using HEX codes. This is done simply by adding two additional digits (forming an 8-digit code), where 00 = 0% opacity = completely invisible.

## Interactive Plots

iNZight can produce interactive versions of plots that you can explore in a web browser — hovering, clicking, and selecting data points.

### Exporting interactive plots (Desktop)

:::info Developmental Feature
This feature is still a work-in-progress. Please play around with it and let us know what you like, what doesn't work so well, and any other feedback you have!
:::

There are two ways to get an interactive plot from iNZight Desktop:

#### Toolbar button

Most single-panel plots have an interactive version. Look for the interactive icon in the [plot toolbar](/docs/interface/plot-toolbar) — a blue icon means one is available, a grey icon means it is not.

Clicking the icon opens the interactive plot directly in your default web browser.

#### Save dialog

You can also export via **Save Plot** (the save icon on the toolbar, or **Plot** menu):

import fig1 from "./FIG1.png";
import fig2 from "./FIG2.png";
import fig3 from "./FIG3.png";
import fig4 from "./FIG4.png";

Let's load the `gapminder-2008` data from the FutureLearn module:

<Figure src={fig1} caption="iNZight Home" width="700" />

**File** > **Example Data** and select the Gapminder 2008 dataset:

<Figure src={fig2} caption="Example Data - gapminder_2008" width="500" />

Now plot some variables. Here we're using ChildrenPerWoman and Infantmortality, coloured by Region and sized by Populationtotal, but you can use whichever you prefer.

<Figure src={fig3} caption="Gapminder plot" width="700" />

Now click the "Save" icon in the [plot toolbar](/docs/interface/plot-toolbar), or from the Plot menu.

<Figure src={fig4} caption="Save dialog" width="400" />

- **File type**: choose "Interactive HTML" (or "SVG" for a static vector image)
- **Save location**: You can leave this as default, which is the iNZightVIT/Saved Plots folder in your Documents.
- **File name**: choose something appropriate
- **Additional variable**: We've selected "Country" as an additional variable to export, so we can use it to label points.

Once you click save, you might be prompted to install additional packages. Click "Yes" and wait while that happens, then you can save again.

### ggplot2 plot types

When you are using one of the [ggplot2-based plot types](/docs/graphics/graph-types/ggplot2), the **Add to Plot** panel includes an **"Interactive Plot (via plotly)"** button that opens the current plot as a plotly widget in your browser. This is available for most gg plot types except pie, donut, gridplot, barcode, and ridgeline.

### Interactive plots (Lite)

In iNZight Lite, the output panel includes two interactive tabs alongside the standard Plot, Summary, and Inference tabs:

- **Interactive Plot** — displays an interactive version of the current plot using iNZight's custom HTML export. You can also download the plot as an HTML file using the **Download Plot** button.
- **Interactive Plot (via plotly)** — displays the plot as a plotly widget with full hover, zoom, and pan support. For large datasets, you may need to click **Produce Plot** to generate the interactive version.

</Lite>

### Interacting with plots

Once you have an interactive plot open:

- **Hover your mouse over points** to see details about that observation
- **Click points** to add to selection, and "View Table" to see the rows of the data set for those observations
- **Click-and-drag** to select a region of points
- **Click a legend label** to highlight points in that group

### Supported plot types

Interactive export works with most single-panel iNZight plots, including scatter plots, dot plots, bar charts, and hexagonal binning plots. **Panel (faceted) plots are not currently supported**, and coloured hexagonal binning plots are not available as interactive versions.

:::note Required packages
Interactive HTML export requires the `gridSVG`, `jsonlite`, and `knitr` packages. SVG export requires `gridSVG`. If they are not installed, iNZight will prompt you to install them when you first try to export.
