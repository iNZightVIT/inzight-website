## Paste from Clipboard {#paste-from}

You can import data directly from Excel or Google Sheets by selecting the data and copying it (CTRL + C) and then using the **Paste from...** option in the **File** menu to paste the data directly into iNZight.

<Desktop>

### Paste Dataset (Lite) {#paste-dataset}

In iNZight Lite, the **Paste Dataset** panel lets you paste data copied from a spreadsheet (Excel, Google Sheets, etc.) directly into the application.

1. **Copy** the data from your spreadsheet (including headers)
2. **Paste** into the text area
3. Choose the **delimiter** that separates columns:
   - Tab (default — works with most spreadsheet copy operations)
   - Comma
   - Semicolon
   - Custom delimiter (type your own)
4. A **preview** of the parsed data is shown on the right
5. Click **Load** to import the dataset, or **Reset** to clear

:::tip
If the preview doesn't look right, try changing the delimiter. Data copied from Excel typically uses tabs, while CSV data uses commas.
