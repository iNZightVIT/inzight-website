The Multiple Response module allows you to explore data from survey questions where respondents can select multiple answers to a single question. For example: "Which of the following colours do you like?" where respondents can check multiple options.

## When to Use This Module

Use this module when:
- You have survey data with "select all that apply" questions
- Each possible response is stored as a separate column
- Values are binary (yes/no, 0/1, true/false)

## Data Format

Multiple response data typically comes in a "wide" format with one column per option:

| respondent | likes_red | likes_blue | likes_green | gender |
|:-----------|:----------|:-----------|:------------|:-------|
| 1 | yes | no | yes | M |
| 2 | yes | yes | no | F |
| 3 | no | no | yes | M |

Each response column contains binary values indicating whether that option was selected.

### Supported Binary Formats

iNZight recognises several formats for binary data:
- Yes/No (or Y/N)
- 1/0
- True/False (or T/F)

## Getting Started

### Accessing the Module

<Desktop>

Go to **Advanced** → **Multiple Response** from the menu bar.

</Desktop>

<Lite>

Select **Multiple Response** from the module dropdown menu.

</Lite>

### Selecting Response Variables

1. **Identify your binary variables**: iNZight automatically detects columns with binary (yes/no) values
2. **Select related variables**: Choose all columns that belong to the same question (e.g., all "likes_colour" columns)
3. **Name your response set**: Give the group of variables a meaningful name

:::tip
Variables from the same question often share a common prefix (e.g., `colour_red`, `colour_blue`, `colour_green`). Look for this pattern when selecting your variables.

## Visualising Multiple Response Data

### Basic Response Plot

The default plot shows the proportion of "yes" responses for each option:

- Each bar represents one response option
- Bar height shows the percentage who selected that option
- Error bars (if enabled) show confidence intervals

### Adding Grouping Variables

Compare response patterns across groups:

1. Select a **grouping variable** (e.g., gender, age group)
2. The plot will show separate bars for each group
3. This reveals how response patterns differ between groups

### Subset Variables

You can also subset the data to focus on specific groups:

1. Add a **subset variable** to filter the data
2. Use the slider to navigate between subset levels
3. Observe how patterns change across subsets

## Interpreting Results

### Response Proportions

- Proportions show what fraction of respondents selected each option
- Because respondents can select multiple options, proportions across all options may sum to more than 100%
- Compare relative heights to see which options are most/least popular

### Group Comparisons

When comparing groups:
- Look for options where groups differ substantially
- Consider whether differences are practically meaningful, not just statistically significant
- Be aware that sample sizes may differ between groups

## Tips

- **Check your data**: Ensure all response variables are properly coded as binary
- **Meaningful names**: Rename variables to be interpretable in plots (e.g., "Red" instead of "colour_red")
- **Consider order**: Arrange response options in a logical order (alphabetical, by frequency, or conceptual grouping)
- **Missing data**: Respondents with missing values on all options will be excluded

## Troubleshooting

### "No binary variables found"

This error appears when iNZight cannot find variables with exactly two values matching recognised patterns (yes/no, 0/1, true/false). Check that:
- Your data contains the expected binary columns
- Values are spelled correctly (e.g., "yes" not "Yes " with trailing space)
- There are no additional values beyond the two expected

### Variables not appearing

If expected variables don't appear in the selection list:
- Verify they have exactly two distinct values (plus possibly missing values)
- Check that values match recognised binary patterns
- Try recoding variables to use standard formats (0/1 or yes/no)
