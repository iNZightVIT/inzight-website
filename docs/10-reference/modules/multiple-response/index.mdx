A module that provides the ability for analysing data with multiple (binary) response options. Think of this as a checkbox answer, as opposed to a radiobox:

**Standard factor variable** (radio buttons - one answer):

| person.id | fav_fruit |
| ---------:| --------- |
| 1         | pear      |
| 2         | apple     |
| 3         | orange    |
| 4         | apple     |

**Multiple Response variable** (checkboxes - multiple answers):

| person.id | fruit_apple | fruit_banana | fruit_pear | fruit_orange |
| ---------:| -----------:| ------------:| ----------:| ------------:|
| 1         | 1           | 0            | 1          | 0            |
| 2         | 1           | 0            | 1          | 1            |
| 3         | 1           | 1            | 1          | 1            |
| 4         | 1           | 0            | 0          | 0            |

Analysing these are going to require two different approaches, and that's where the Multiple Response module comes in!

:::note Quick note on coding
In the table above, we've used 1's and 0's to code whether or not someone checked the box. This is the easiest way, however you can also provide "yes" (=1) or "no" (=0) if you prefer.
:::

## Getting Started

First, you'll need to load an appropriate dataset (i.e., one that has data coded like the table above).
For this example, we will be using the **Census at School 5000** dataset, which you can load by going to **File** > **Example data**, select **Multiple response** as the module, and **census.at.school.5000** for the data.
Once you've loaded this, you can go to **Advanced** menu and click **Multiple Response**, which will load the module.

import mrHome from "./1_multipleresponse_home.png";

The **Census at School 5000** dataset contains several variables, each with multiple responses.
Here, we will investigate **tech**: each student was asked to select all technologies they have used.

## Generating Graphs

Once you've loading the Multiple Response window, you'll be able to select variables to compare.
In our example, we will use the variable **tech**, and select the responses **tv**, **internet**, **facebook**, **twitter**, and **skype**.

:::tip
To select multiple variables, hold the CTRL key (or Command on Mac).

import mrPlot from "./2_multipleresponse_plot.png";

The Summary and Combinations buttons will give you summary tables of the data, and a "visual" graph of the combinations occurring in the dataset.

## Sub-setting the Graph

As with the main iNZight module, you can split the graph into several **subsets** to better explore trends.
In the example below, we have selected **age** as the sub-setting variable. Because age is a numeric, iNZight has divided it into four groups.

import mrSubset from "./3_multipleresponse_subset.png";

<Figure src={mrSubset} caption="Multiple response subsetting" width="600" />

To delve further into trends, you can use two sub-setting variables.
First, we'll pick a new set of responses: **tv**, **mp3**, **facebook**, **twitter**, and **console**.
The first sub-setting variable is **gender**, and the second is **age**.

import mrSubset2 from "./4_multipleresponse_subset2.png";

<Figure src={mrSubset2} caption="Multiple response subsetting with two variables" width="600" />

If we want to more easily compare the first sub-setting variable, we can check the box **Display subset variable 1 side-by-side**:

import mrSideBySide from "./5_multipleresponse_subset_sidebyside.png";
