The Multivariate module provides tools for exploring datasets with many variables simultaneously. It includes visualization techniques like pairs plots and parallel coordinates, as well as dimension reduction methods like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Multidimensional Scaling (MDS).

## Features

- **Pairs Plot**: Scatter plot matrix of selected variables
- **Correlation Pairs Plot**: Pairs plot with correlation coefficients
- **Parallel Coordinates**: Visualize many variables on parallel axes
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: Reduce dimensions while preserving variance
- **Multidimensional Scaling (MDS)**: Visualize distances between observations

## Getting Started

Select **Multivariate** from the module dropdown menu in iNZight Lite.

## Methods

### Pairs Plot

Creates a matrix of scatter plots for all pairs of selected variables.

**Options:**
- **Select variables**: Choose which numeric variables to include

**Use for:**
- Identifying correlations between variables
- Spotting clusters or groups in the data
- Finding potential outliers

### Correlation Pairs Plot

Similar to the pairs plot but includes correlation coefficients for each pair.

**Features:**
- Scatter plots in one triangle
- Correlation values in the other triangle
- Useful for quick assessment of linear relationships

### Parallel Coordinates

Displays each observation as a line crossing parallel vertical axes, one for each variable.

**Options:**
- **Select variables**: Choose which variables to display
- **Colour by**: Colour lines by a categorical variable
- **Transparency**: Adjust opacity when lines overlap

**Use for:**
- Identifying patterns across many variables
- Spotting clusters based on similar profiles
- Finding outliers with unusual patterns

### Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

Reduces the dimensionality of data by creating new variables (principal components) that capture the most variance.

**Options:**
- **Select variables**: Choose numeric variables for the analysis
- **Colour by**: Colour points by a categorical variable
- **Shape by**: Use different shapes for a categorical variable
- **Dimensions to plot**: Select which principal components to display (default: PC1 vs PC2)

**Output:**
- **PCA biplot**: Shows observations and variable loadings
- **Summary**: Variance explained by each component
- **Screeplot**: Visual display of variance per component

**Use for:**
- Reducing many correlated variables to fewer dimensions
- Identifying which variables drive the main patterns
- Visualizing high-dimensional data in 2D

### Multidimensional Scaling (MDS)

Creates a low-dimensional representation that preserves distances between observations.

**Options:**
- **Colour by**: Colour points by a categorical variable
- **Shape by**: Use different shapes for a categorical variable
- **N dimensions to decompose to**: Number of dimensions to compute
- **Dimensions to plot**: Select which dimensions to display

**Use for:**
- Visualizing similarity/dissimilarity between observations
- Exploring clustering structure
- When you want to preserve distances rather than variance

## Interpreting Results

### PCA Biplots

- **Points**: Individual observations projected onto principal components
- **Arrows**: Direction and strength of original variable contributions
- **Clustering**: Groups of points indicate similar observations
- **Arrow direction**: Variables pointing the same way are positively correlated

### Variance Explained

In PCA, check the summary table and screeplot:
- First few components should explain most variance (>70-80% is often good)
- Look for an "elbow" in the screeplot to decide how many components to retain

### MDS Plots

- **Distance between points**: Similar observations are close together
- **Look for clusters**: Groups of nearby points may represent natural groupings
- **Outliers**: Isolated points may be unusual observations

## Tips

- **Start simple**: Begin with a pairs plot to understand pairwise relationships
- **Choose variables carefully**: Include only relevant numeric variables
- **Use colour**: Adding a grouping variable often reveals structure
- **Check variance**: In PCA, ensure enough variance is captured by the plotted components
- **Compare methods**: PCA and MDS may reveal different patterns - try both

## Troubleshooting

### Plot looks crowded

- Reduce the number of variables
- Increase transparency for parallel coordinates
- Consider using PCA to reduce dimensions first

### PCA shows no clear pattern

- Check that variables have different scales (consider standardization)
- Try colouring by a known grouping variable
- The data may genuinely have no strong multivariate structure

### MDS takes a long time

- MDS can be slow with many observations
- Consider using a random sample for initial exploration
- Reduce the number of dimensions being computed
