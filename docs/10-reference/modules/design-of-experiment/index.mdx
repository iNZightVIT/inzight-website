The Design of Experiment module provides tools for analysing data from planned experiments using Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). It supports various experimental designs including one-way, two-way, and three-way ANOVA with or without blocking.

## Features

- **Standard ANOVA designs**: Pre-configured one-way, two-way, and three-way ANOVA
- **Blocking**: Support for randomized block designs
- **Custom models**: Build your own ANOVA model with fixed and random effects
- **Interaction plots**: Visualize interactions between factors
- **Treatment means**: Compute and display treatment mean tables

## Getting Started

Select **Design of Experiment** from the module dropdown menu in iNZight Lite.

## ANOVA Analysis

### Standard Designs

Choose from pre-configured experimental designs:

| Design | Description |
|:-------|:------------|
| One-way ANOVA (no blocking) | Single treatment factor |
| One-way ANOVA (randomized blocks) | Single treatment with blocking |
| Two-way ANOVA (no blocking) | Two treatment factors |
| Two-way ANOVA (randomized blocks) | Two treatments with blocking |
| Three-way ANOVA (no blocking) | Three treatment factors |
| Three-way ANOVA (randomized blocks) | Three treatments with blocking |

### Setting Up a Standard Design

1. Select **Standard design** option
2. Choose the appropriate design from the dropdown
3. Select your response variable
4. Select treatment factor(s) and blocking variable (if applicable)
5. Click **Fit Model**

### Custom Models

For more complex designs, use **Customized design**:

1. Select your **response variable**
2. Check **Explanatory component (fixed effect)** and select fixed effect variables
3. Check **Structural component (random effect)** for random effects (e.g., blocks)
4. Specify treatment means option (complete or incomplete blocks)
5. Click **Fit Model**

## Understanding the Output

### ANOVA Summary

The ANOVA table shows:

- **Source**: Effect names (treatments, blocks, interactions, residuals)
- **Df**: Degrees of freedom
- **Sum Sq**: Sum of squares
- **Mean Sq**: Mean square (Sum Sq / Df)
- **F value**: F-statistic for testing significance
- **Pr(>F)**: p-value for the F-test

### Treatment Means

Tables showing the mean response for each level of each factor. Use these to:

- Compare treatment effects
- Identify the best-performing treatment levels
- Understand interaction patterns

## Interaction Plots

The **Interaction Plot** tab visualizes how factors interact:

1. Select the **Interaction Plot** tab
2. Choose the x-axis factor
3. Choose the grouping factor (lines)
4. View the resulting plot

### Interpreting Interaction Plots

- **Parallel lines**: No interaction - effects are additive
- **Non-parallel lines**: Interaction present - effect of one factor depends on the level of another
- **Crossing lines**: Strong interaction - the ranking of treatments changes between groups

## Model Management

- **Select Fitted Model**: Switch between saved models
- **Remove**: Delete the selected model

## Tips

- **Check assumptions**: ANOVA assumes normality and equal variances
- **Use blocking**: Include blocking factors to reduce error variance
- **Consider interactions**: If lines aren't parallel in interaction plots, include interaction terms
- **Balance your design**: ANOVA works best with equal sample sizes in each cell

## Troubleshooting

### Model won't fit

- Ensure you have selected both a response variable and at least one factor
- Check that your factor has more than one level
- Verify there are observations for each combination of factor levels

### Results seem wrong

- Check that variables are correctly classified (categorical vs. numeric)
- Ensure blocking variables are included if your design has blocks
- Verify data entry - look for outliers or data errors
