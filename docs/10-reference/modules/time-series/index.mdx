The Time Series module provides tools for exploring and analysing time series data. It is built on the modern [tidyverts](https://tidyverts.org/) ecosystem, providing flexible handling of various time series formats and powerful visualisation capabilities.

:::tip
This is the recommended Time Series module. If you need access to the older version (pre-2023), see [Time Series (Legacy)](/docs/reference/modules/time-series-legacy).
:::

## Features

- **Flexible time formats**: Supports various time frequencies (yearly, quarterly, monthly, weekly, daily, hourly)
- **Multiple series**: Handle panel data with "keys" to analyse multiple related time series
- **Modern decomposition**: STL decomposition to separate trend, seasonal, and residual components
- **ARIMA forecasting**: Automatic model selection for accurate predictions
- **Interactive plots**: Built with ggplot2 for high-quality, customisable graphics

## Getting Started

### Accessing the Module

**Desktop**: Go to **Advanced** → **Time Series**

**Lite**: Select **Time Series** from the module dropdown menu

### Preparing Your Data

Your data should have:
1. A **time/date column** - containing dates, timestamps, or time codes
2. One or more **measurement columns** - the values to analyse over time
3. (Optional) **Key columns** - categorical variables identifying different series in panel data

### Time Information

Select your time variable from the dropdown. iNZight will automatically detect the time format if possible. Supported formats include:

| Format | Examples |
|:-------|:---------|
| Dates | `2023-01-15`, `15/01/2023`, `Jan 2023` |
| Quarters | `2023Q1`, `2023-Q1`, `Q1 2023` |
| Year-Month | `2023M01`, `2023-01`, `Jan-2023` |
| Year-Week | `2023W01`, `2023-W01` |
| Years | `2023`, `Y2023` |

### Working with Multiple Series (Keys)

If your data contains multiple time series (e.g., sales data for different regions), select the identifying variable(s) as **Keys**. This allows iNZight to:
- Plot all series together for comparison
- Decompose and forecast each series separately
- Highlight specific series of interest

## Plot Types

### Default Plot

Shows the raw time series with an optional smoother overlay. Use this to:
- Identify overall trends
- Spot outliers or unusual patterns
- Compare multiple series

**Options:**
- **Show smoother**: Toggle trend line on/off
- **Smoothness**: Adjust the smoothness of the trend (0-100)
- **Seasonally adjust series**: Remove seasonal effects to see underlying trend

### Decomposition Plot

Breaks the time series into components:
- **Trend**: The long-term direction of the data
- **Seasonal**: Repeating patterns within each period
- **Remainder**: What's left after removing trend and season

Choose between **Additive** (Season + Trend + Remainder = Data) or **Multiplicative** (Season × Trend × Remainder = Data) decomposition based on whether seasonal variation changes with the level of the series.

### Seasonal Plot

Displays the seasonal pattern by overlaying data from each period (year, week, etc.) on the same axes. This helps identify:
- Consistent seasonal patterns
- Changes in seasonal behaviour over time
- Anomalous periods

### Forecast Plot

Generates predictions for future time points using ARIMA models. The plot shows:
- Historical data
- Fitted values
- Future predictions with confidence intervals

## Settings

### Seasonal Pattern

- **Additive**: Use when seasonal fluctuations are roughly constant regardless of the level
- **Multiplicative**: Use when seasonal fluctuations grow proportionally with the level

### Variable Types

- **Numeric Variables**: Standard time series of measurements
- **Categorical Variables**: Track how category proportions change over time

### Range Settings

Adjust the time range to focus on specific periods of interest. This affects both the display and the data used for model fitting.

## Tips

1. **Start with the default plot** to get an overview of your data
2. **Check decomposition** to understand the underlying structure
3. **Use seasonal plots** to verify seasonal patterns before forecasting
4. **Adjust smoothness** - lower values show more detail, higher values show clearer trends
5. **For forecasting**, ensure you have enough historical data (typically at least 2-3 complete seasonal cycles)
