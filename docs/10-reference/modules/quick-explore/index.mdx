The Quick Explore sub-menu provides several tools for rapid, automated exploration of a dataset. These are particularly useful when working with a new dataset and wanting to get an overview before diving into specific analyses.

Access via **Advanced** > **Quick Explore**.

## Missing Values

Opens a summary window showing the extent of missing data across all variables in the dataset. The output includes:

- A **text summary** table listing each variable and the number/percentage of missing values
- A **combination plot** showing which combinations of variables have missing values together

This uses the `iNZightMR` package's `calcmissing()` and `plotcombn()` functions to compute and visualise missing data patterns. Understanding which variables are missing and whether missingness is related across variables is an important first step in any analysis.

## All 1-Variable Plots

Automatically steps through every variable in the dataset, plotting each one individually. For each variable, iNZight produces the appropriate default plot:

- **Numeric variables**: [Dot plot](/docs/graphics/graph-types/dot) (or [histogram](/docs/graphics/graph-types/hist) for large datasets)
- **Categorical variables**: [Bar chart](/docs/graphics/graph-types/bar)

Use the **Next** and **Previous** buttons to cycle through variables. This is a quick way to spot unusual distributions, outliers, or unexpected variable types.

## All 1-Variable Summaries

Produces a text summary for every variable in the dataset in a single window. For each variable, the summary includes:

- **Numeric variables**: Mean, standard deviation, min, quartiles, max, and number of missing values
- **Categorical variables**: Frequency table of levels

This provides a comprehensive numeric overview of the entire dataset at a glance.

## Explore 2-Variable Plots

Select a **reference variable**, and iNZight will step through plotting every other variable in the dataset against it. This is useful for quickly identifying which variables have interesting relationships with a variable of interest.

The plot type is chosen automatically based on the variable types:
- **Numeric vs. Numeric**: [Scatter plot](/docs/graphics/graph-types/scatter)
- **Numeric vs. Categorical**: [Dot plot](/docs/graphics/graph-types/dot) grouped by category
- **Categorical vs. Categorical**: [Bar chart](/docs/graphics/graph-types/bar) (two-way)

## Pairs

Creates a **scatter plot matrix** (pairs plot) for a user-selected set of variables. Each variable is plotted against every other variable in a grid layout, making it easy to identify correlations and patterns across multiple variables simultaneously.

- Hold **CTRL** (or **CMD** on Mac) to select multiple variables
- Optionally select a **colour variable** to colour all plots by a grouping variable

This uses R's `gpairs` package to produce the matrix.
