:::info Desktop Only
The 3D Plot module is only available in iNZight Desktop. It requires the `plot3D` package and optionally `plot3Drgl` for interactive rotation.

The 3D Plot module allows you to visualize relationships between three numeric variables in a three-dimensional scatter plot. This can help reveal patterns and relationships that might not be visible in standard two-dimensional plots.

## Features

- **3D scatter plots**: Plot three numeric variables simultaneously
- **Rotation controls**: Adjust viewing angle with phi and theta controls
- **Grouping**: Colour points by a categorical variable
- **Interactive mode**: Rotate plots interactively (requires `plot3Drgl`)

## Getting Started

### Accessing the Module

Go to **Advanced** → **3D Plot** from the menu bar in iNZight Desktop.

:::note
If this is your first time using the module, iNZight may need to download additional R packages (`plot3D` and optionally `plot3Drgl`). This happens automatically.

## Creating a 3D Plot

### Variable Selection

1. **X Variable**: Select a numeric variable for the X-axis
2. **Y Variable**: Select a numeric variable for the Y-axis
3. **Z Variable**: Select a numeric variable for the Z-axis (vertical)

All three variables must be numeric.

### Grouping by Category

Optionally select a **grouping variable** to colour the points by category. This helps identify clusters or patterns within different groups.

## Adjusting the View

### Rotation Angles

Two angles control the viewing perspective:

- **Theta (θ)**: Horizontal rotation angle (azimuth) - rotates the view left/right
- **Phi (φ)**: Vertical rotation angle (elevation) - tilts the view up/down

Adjust these sliders to find the best viewing angle for your data.

### Interactive Rotation

If the `plot3Drgl` package is installed, you can rotate the plot interactively by clicking and dragging on the plot. This provides a more intuitive way to explore your data from different angles.

## Interpreting 3D Plots

### Looking for Patterns

When examining a 3D plot, look for:

- **Clusters**: Groups of points that appear close together
- **Linear relationships**: Points forming a plane or line in 3D space
- **Outliers**: Points that are far from the main cluster
- **Interactions**: Patterns that only appear when viewing from certain angles

### Limitations

Keep in mind:

- 3D visualizations can be difficult to interpret on a 2D screen
- Depth perception can be misleading - rotate the plot to confirm patterns
- With many points, plots can become cluttered
- Sometimes multiple 2D plots are more effective than one 3D plot

## Tips

- **Start with 2D**: Before creating a 3D plot, explore your data with 2D scatter plots first
- **Use grouping**: Adding a grouping variable can help distinguish different populations
- **Rotate extensively**: View the plot from multiple angles before drawing conclusions
- **Consider alternatives**: Pairs plots or faceted 2D plots may sometimes be more informative

## Troubleshooting

### Plot not appearing

- Ensure all three variables are numeric
- Check that you've selected variables (not "Select X Variable", etc.)
- Try adjusting the rotation angles

### Cannot rotate interactively

- Interactive rotation requires the `plot3Drgl` package
- This package may not install on all systems (requires OpenGL support)
- Use the theta/phi sliders as an alternative
