This module provides users with the ability to plot three **numeric** variables simultaneously on a 3-dimensional axis. A fourth categorical variable can be used to colour the points. The image can be rotated and spun, allowing users to explore relationships between variables.

Access via **Advanced** > **3D Plot**.

Provides access to code from [John Fox's R Commander](http://www.rcommander.com/).
