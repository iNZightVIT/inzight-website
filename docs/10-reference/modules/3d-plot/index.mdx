The 3D Plot module provides an interactive three-dimensional scatter plot for exploring relationships between three numeric variables. A fourth categorical variable can optionally be used to colour the points by group.

Access via **Advanced** > **3D Plot**.

:::note Requirements
This module requires the `rgl` and `car` R packages to be installed. If they are not available, iNZight will prompt you to install them.

## Getting Started

The module opens a control window with four variable slots:

- **Response** (Y-axis): A numeric variable
- **Covariate 1** (X-axis): A numeric variable
- **Covariate 2** (Z-axis): A numeric variable
- **Group by** (optional): A categorical variable for colouring points by group

Drag variable names from the dataset into the appropriate slots, or use the dropdowns to select them. Use the **clear** buttons to remove a variable from a slot.

## Interacting with the Plot

The 3D scatter plot opens in a separate interactive window powered by the `rgl` package:

- **Click and drag** to rotate the plot
- **Scroll** to zoom in and out
- **Right-click and drag** to pan

The ability to rotate the plot freely helps you identify patterns, clusters, and outliers that may not be visible in any single 2D projection.

## Fitted Surfaces

You can overlay fitted surfaces on the scatter plot to visualise the modelled relationship between the response and the two covariates. Available surface types:

| Surface | Description |
|---|---|
| **Linear** | Flat plane fitted by linear regression |
| **Quadratic** | Curved surface including squared and interaction terms |
| **Smooth** | Flexible surface fitted using a GAM (requires `mgcv` package) |
| **Additive** | Additive model with separate smooths for each covariate (requires `mgcv`) |

When a **Group by** variable is set, surfaces can be fitted:
- **In parallel** — same shape but shifted for each group
- **Separately** — independently fitted for each group

## Display Options

The control panel provides several options for customising the plot:

- **Show residuals**: Draw vertical lines from each point to the fitted surface
- **Show surface**: Toggle the fitted surface on/off
- **Fill / Grid**: Show the surface as a filled surface, wireframe grid, or both
- **Sphere size**: Adjust the size of points in the 3D space
- **Axes**: Show or hide axis labels and scales
- **Spin**: Automatically rotate the plot

## Tips

- Start by looking at the raw scatter with no surface to identify the general pattern
- Add a linear surface first, then try quadratic or smooth to see if the relationship is non-linear
- Use the **Group by** variable to see if the relationship differs across categories
- Rotate the plot to view it from different angles — relationships can look very different from different perspectives
