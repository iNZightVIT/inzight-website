title: Aggregate
description: Aggregate a date or time variable to a lower level of detail.

import { Desktop, Lite } from "@site/src/components/VersionToggle/inzVersion";

This allows you to aggregate a date or time variable to a lower level of detail. For example, you can convert a daily variable to a monthly variable by aggregating the daily values to the monthly level.

To aggregate, go to **<Lite>Manipulate </Lite>Variables** > **Dates and Times** > \*_Aggregate to..._.

import aggregate from "./aggregate.png";

Converts to

- a **_weekly_** (_e.g. 2019 W7_),
- **_monthly_** (_e.g. 2019 M5_),
- **_quarterly_** (_e.g. 2019 Q3_), or
- **_yearly_** (_e.g. 2019_) variable

in the form that the time series module likes and aggregates using **_sum_**, **_mean_**, or **_median_**.

In the Example, `origintime` is a date-time variable (thus, annotated `(t)` in View Variables) and we have chosen to convert it to monthly (`yyyy Myy`) with all of the values in the same month aggregated to their `mean`.

The `count` column shows how many values have been aggregated. If there are missing values present in a variable being aggregated, then another column of the form `variable.missing`. Missing values are ignored when aggregating.

In the Example below a categorical variable in monthly (`yyyy Mzz`) format is aggregated to quarterly (`yyyy Qz`).
