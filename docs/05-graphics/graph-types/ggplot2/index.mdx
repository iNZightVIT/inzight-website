In addition to the default plot types (dot plot, histogram, scatter plot, bar chart, hexagonal binning, and grid density), iNZight offers a range of **alternative plot types** built with `ggplot2`. These are available via the **Plot Type** dropdown in the [Add to Plot](/docs/graphics/plot-features/plot-appearance) panel and are labelled with a `(gg)` prefix.

## Accessing gg plot types

1. Create a plot by selecting variables in the [control panel](/docs/interface/control-panel)
2. Open **Add to Plot** from the [plot toolbar](/docs/interface/plot-toolbar)
3. Under **Plot Type**, use the dropdown to select an alternative `(gg)` plot type

The available options depend on the types of variables you have selected.

:::note Required packages
ggplot2 plot types require several packages to be installed: `ggplot2`, `ggtext`, `dplyr`, `tidyr`, `forcats`, `ggmosaic`, `waffle`, `ggthemes`, `ggbeeswarm`, and `ggridges`. If any are missing, iNZight will display the installation command needed.
:::

:::caution Survey data
ggplot2 plot types are **not available** when a survey design is active. Only the default iNZight plot types are supported for survey data.

## Available plot types

### Numeric variables (one numeric, or numeric vs categorical)

These are alternatives to the default **dot plot** and **histogram**:

| Plot type | Description |
|---|---|
| **(gg) dot strip** | Individual points arranged along a strip |
| **(gg) barcode** | Thin vertical lines marking each observation |
| **(gg) boxplot** | Traditional box-and-whisker plot |
| **(gg) beeswarm** | Points spread to avoid overlap, revealing distribution shape |
| **(gg) violin** | Mirrored density curve showing distribution shape |
| **(gg) density** | Smooth density curve |
| **(gg) cumulative curve** | Cumulative frequency/proportion curve |
| **(gg) column/row bar** | Values plotted as individual bars (one numeric variable only) |
| **(gg) lollipop** | Dot-on-a-stick chart for individual values (one numeric variable only) |

When a **second categorical variable** is selected:

| Plot type | Description |
|---|---|
| **(gg) density (ridgeline)** | Overlapping density curves stacked by group |
| **(gg) pyramid** | Back-to-back bars for comparing two groups (binary second variable only) |

### Categorical variables (one or two categorical)

These are alternatives to the default **bar chart**:

| Plot type | Description |
|---|---|
| **(gg) column/row bar** | Column or row chart of counts |
| **(gg) stacked column/row** | Stacked bars showing composition |
| **(gg) lollipop** | Dot-on-a-stick chart of counts |

With **one categorical variable** only:

| Plot type | Description |
|---|---|
| **(gg) gridplot** | A waffle-style grid showing counts per square |
| **(gg) pie** | Pie chart |
| **(gg) donut** | Donut chart (ring-shaped pie) |

With **two categorical variables**:

| Plot type | Description |
|---|---|
| **(gg) frequency polygons** | Line chart of category counts across groups |
| **(gg) heatmap** | Colour-coded grid showing counts at each combination |
| **(gg) spine/pyramid** | Spine plot for binary second variable |
| **(gg) diverging stacked bar (Likert)** | Diverging bars centred around a midpoint (3+ levels in first variable) |

### Multiple variables

When multiple categorical variables are dragged into Variable 1 simultaneously:

| Plot type | Description |
|---|---|
| **(gg) multiple bar** | Side-by-side bars for each variable |
| **(gg) multiple stacked column** | Stacked column chart across variables |
| **(gg) multiple binary column** | Binary comparison chart (two-level variables only) |

## Themes

All gg plot types support a **Theme** selector in the Add to Plot panel. Themes control the overall visual style of the plot — background, grid lines, fonts, and colours.

The following themes are always available:

| Theme | Description |
|---|---|
| **Default** | Standard ggplot2 grey theme |
| **Black & White** | White background with black elements |
| **Light** | Light grey background |
| **Dark** | Dark background with light text |
| **Minimal** | Clean, minimal styling |
| **Classic** | Traditional white background with axis lines |
| **Void** | No background, axes, or grid — just the data |

If the `ggthemes` package is installed, additional themes become available:

| Theme | Style |
|---|---|
| **Stata** | Stata statistical software |
| **Wall Street Journal** | WSJ chart styling |
| **Tufte** | Edward Tufte's minimalist aesthetic |
| **Google Docs** | Google Docs chart colours |
| **FiveThirtyEight** | FiveThirtyEight journalism style |
| **Excel** | Microsoft Excel default chart |
| **Economist** | _The Economist_ magazine charts |

If `ggthemes` is not installed, an "Install additional themes..." option appears in the dropdown.

## Colour palettes

Many gg plot types provide a **Colour palette** selector for choosing a colour scheme. The available palettes vary by plot type and include both sequential and qualitative colour scales.

## Rotation

Most gg plot types support **rotation** options:

- **Rotate plot**: Swap the x and y axes (e.g., turn vertical bars into horizontal bars)
- **Rotate x-axis labels**: Angle the x-axis labels for readability
- **Rotate y-axis labels**: Angle the y-axis labels for readability

Rotation is not available for pie and donut charts.

:::tip
Some plot types — such as boxplot, violin, beeswarm, and lollipop — are rotated (horizontal) by default. Ticking the "Rotate" checkbox will switch them to vertical orientation.
:::

## Plot-specific options

Certain gg plot types have additional controls:

| Plot type | Options |
|---|---|
| **Violin / Density** | Smoothing adjustment slider |
| **Barcode** | Size slider |
| **Barcode (grouped)** | Width and height sliders |
| **Beeswarm / Quasirandom** | Point size, swarm width, and method |
| **Dot strip** | Point size and transparency |
| **Lollipop** | Line width, point size, and labels |
| **Population pyramid** | Number of bins |
| **Diverging stacked bar** | Cutpoint selection |
| **Gridplot** | Observations per square |

## Code access

<Desktop>

For gg plot types, the Add to Plot panel includes two additional buttons:

- **Store code**: Saves the ggplot2 code that generated the current plot to the code history
- **View code**: Opens the stored code history window where you can review and copy ggplot2 code

This lets you reproduce the plot outside of iNZight or customise it further using R.

</Desktop>

## Interactive plots

Most gg plot types include an **"Interactive Plot (via plotly)"** button in the Add to Plot panel. Clicking it converts the current ggplot2 plot into an interactive plotly widget that opens in your web browser, allowing hovering, zooming, and panning.

This is not available for: pie, donut, gridplot, barcode, or ridgeline plots.

See [Interactive Plots](/docs/reference/advanced-features#interactive-plots) for more details.
