title: Trend Lines and Curves
description: Add trend lines and curves to your plots.
---

The **Trend Lines and Curves** options in **Add to Plot** allow you to overlay various types of fitted lines and curves on scatter plots, [hexagonal binning plots](/docs/graphics/graph-types/hex), and [grid density plots](/docs/graphics/graph-types/grid). These help reveal the underlying relationship between two numeric variables.

## Trend lines

Trend lines fit polynomial models to the data. You can add one or more of the following:

<Figure src={trendLinear} caption="Scatter plot with a linear trend line" width="500" />

- **Linear**: A straight line (first-degree polynomial). This is the most common trend line and corresponds to simple linear regression. iNZight draws this in **blue** by default.
- **Quadratic**: A curved line (second-degree polynomial) that can capture U-shaped or inverted-U relationships. Drawn in **red** by default.
- **Cubic**: A more flexible curve (third-degree polynomial) that can capture S-shaped relationships. Drawn in **green** by default.

You can display multiple trend lines simultaneously to compare fits.

### Trend lines with colour-by groups

When a [colour-by](/docs/graphics/plot-features/colour) variable is set, trend lines can be drawn **separately for each group**. There are two options:

- **Separate trends**: Each group gets its own independently fitted line, allowing slopes and intercepts to differ.
- **Parallel trends**: All groups share the same slope but are allowed different intercepts. This is useful for testing whether the relationship between x and y is the same across groups.

## Smoothing curves

<Figure src={trendSmooth} caption="Scatter plot with a LOESS smoothing curve" width="500" />

A **smoother** fits a flexible curve that follows the local pattern of the data, using the LOESS (locally estimated scatterplot smoothing) method. The smoothing parameter controls how closely the curve follows the data:

- Values close to **0** produce a very wiggly curve that follows the data closely
- Values close to **1** produce a smoother, less reactive curve
- The default smoothing value is 0.7

Smoothers are drawn in **magenta** by default and include a shaded confidence band showing uncertainty.

## Quantile smoothers

Quantile smoothers show how different parts of the distribution change across the x-axis. Instead of fitting to the mean, they fit curves to specific quantiles (e.g., the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles). The specific quantiles displayed depend on the sample size:

- For smaller datasets, the median (50th percentile) is shown
- For larger datasets, additional quantiles (e.g., 25th/75th or 10th/90th) are added automatically

## Line of equality

<Figure src={trendLoe} caption="Scatter plot with a line of equality (x = y)" width="500" />

The **line of equality** (x = y) is a dashed diagonal line that shows where points would fall if both variables had the same value. This is useful when comparing two measurements of the same thing (e.g., pre-test vs. post-test scores, or predicted vs. observed values).

- Drawn as a **black dashed line** by default
- Points above the line indicate y > x; points below indicate y < x

## Join points

The **join** option connects data points with straight lines in order. This is most useful for time-ordered data where you want to see the trajectory of observations.

## Inference with trend lines

When [inference](/docs/graphics/inference) is enabled alongside trend lines, iNZight displays:

- **Confidence bands** (shaded regions) around trend lines, showing the uncertainty of the fitted relationship
- **Bootstrap trend lines** (when bootstrap inference is selected), showing the variability of the fitted line across resampled datasets

The [numeric summary](/docs/interface/control-panel) for scatter plots with trend lines includes regression coefficients, confidence intervals, and p-values for each polynomial term.
