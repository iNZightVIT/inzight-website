description: Using point size to encode a numeric variable.
---

In a scatter plot, you can encode a third variable by mapping it to the **size** of the points. This is sometimes called a _bubble chart_ and is effective for displaying three numeric dimensions simultaneously.

import size from "../../screenshots/size.png";

## How to add size

To map a variable to point size, select a **numeric variable** from the **Size by** dropdown in the **Add to Plot** panel.

## How it works

- Point sizes are scaled proportionally to the values of the selected variable
- Larger values produce larger points; smaller values produce smaller points
- Missing values in the size variable are shown as small cross symbols to indicate they are present in the data but lack a size value
- A legend shows the mapping from values to point sizes

## Resize methods

iNZight provides two methods for sizing points:

- **Proportional** (default): Point sizes are directly proportional to the variable values. This gives an intuitive mapping where the visual size reflects the data value.
- **Emphasize**: An alternative method that can make differences in size more prominent.

## Tips for use

- Size works best when the numeric variable has a meaningful range — if all values are similar, the size differences will be hard to see
- Combining size with [colour](/docs/graphics/plot-features/colour) allows you to display up to four variables at once (x, y, colour, size)
- Be mindful that large points can overlap and obscure smaller points. Adjusting [transparency](/docs/graphics/plot-features/plot-appearance) can help

## Applicable plot types

Size mapping is available for **scatter plots** only.
