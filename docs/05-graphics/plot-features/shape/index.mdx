description: Control the shape of points to encode categorical information.

Shape mapping allows you to use different point symbols to represent levels of a categorical variable. This is particularly useful for making plots accessible to people with colour vision deficiencies, either on its own or in combination with [colour](/docs/graphics/plot-features/colour).

import shape from "../../screenshots/shape.png";

<Figure src={shape} caption="Scatter plot with points shaped by a categorical variable" width="500" />

## How to add shape

To map a variable to point shape, select a **categorical variable** from the **Symbol by** dropdown in the **Add to Plot** panel.

## How it works

- Each level of the selected variable is assigned a different plotting symbol (circle, triangle, square, diamond, inverted triangle)
- A legend is displayed showing which symbol maps to which category
- Up to **5 distinct shapes** are available, so this feature works best with variables that have a small number of levels
- Missing values are shown with a cross symbol

:::tip Accessibility

Shape is one of the best tools for making scatter plots accessible. Even when printed in black-and-white or viewed by someone with colour blindness, the groups remain distinguishable. For maximum clarity, use shape together with [colour](/docs/graphics/plot-features/colour).

## Applicable plot types

Shape mapping is available for **scatter plots** and **dot plots**. Other plot types do not use individual point symbols.
