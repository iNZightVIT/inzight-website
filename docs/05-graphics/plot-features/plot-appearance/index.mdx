title: Plot Appearance
description: Additional appearance customization options for plots.
---

The **Customise Plot Appearance** options in **Add to Plot** provide fine-grained control over the visual properties of your plots. These settings go beyond colour, shape, and size to cover transparency, layout, and other visual details.

## Transparency (alpha)

Transparency controls how see-through points are. This is especially useful for dense scatter plots where many points overlap:

- **Alpha = 1** (default): Fully opaque points
- **Alpha closer to 0**: More transparent points, allowing overlapping regions to show as darker areas
- When transparency is applied, the point fill automatically changes from transparent to filled, so the alpha effect is visible

:::tip Overplotting

If your scatter plot looks like a solid blob, reducing transparency is one of the best ways to reveal density patterns. You can also try [jitter](#jitter) or switching to a [hexagonal binning plot](/docs/graphics/graph-types/hex).

## Jitter

Jitter adds a small amount of random noise to point positions. This is useful when data values are rounded or discrete, causing many points to stack on top of each other:

- **x**: Jitter on the horizontal axis only
- **y**: Jitter on the vertical axis only
- **xy**: Jitter on both axes

Jitter does not change the underlying data — it only affects the visual positions of points on the plot.

## Rugs

Rugs are small tick marks along the axes that show the marginal distribution of each variable individually:

- **x**: Show rug marks along the x-axis
- **y**: Show rug marks along the y-axis
- **xy**: Show rug marks along both axes

Rugs are helpful for seeing where observations are concentrated along each axis, even when the scatter plot itself is hard to read.

## Plot type override

You can override the automatically selected plot type to switch between different visualisations of the same two numeric variables:

- **Scatter plot**: The standard point-by-point display
- **Grid density plot**: A [grid density](/docs/graphics/graph-types/grid) representation
- **Hexagonal binning plot**: A [hexagonal binning](/docs/graphics/graph-types/hex) representation

This is useful if iNZight has automatically selected a large-sample plot type (e.g., hex plot) but you prefer a different view, or vice versa.

## Point size

The overall size of points can be scaled up or down using the **point size** control. This affects all points uniformly (unlike [Size by variable](/docs/graphics/plot-features/size), which scales points based on data values).

## Point fill

Controls the fill colour of plotted points:

- **Transparent** (default): Points show only their outline colour
- **Fill**: Points are filled with their colour, which interacts with the [transparency](#transparency-alpha) setting

## Background colour

Changes the background colour of the plot area. The default is a light grey (`#eeeeee`). Grid lines automatically adjust their colour based on the background.

## Grid lines

Toggle the display of grid lines in the plot area. Grid lines help with reading values but can be turned off for cleaner presentations.

## Box plot (dot plots and histograms)

For dot plots and histograms, you can toggle the display of the accompanying **box-and-whisker plot**, which shows the median, quartiles, and potential outliers.
