description: Using colour to add information to a graph.

Colour is one of the most common ways of adding a third variable to a plot, and can be very effective in revealing differences between groups or patterns in the data.

## How to add colour

To colour points by a variable, select the variable from the **Colour by** dropdown in the [control panel](/docs/interface/control-panel). The type of colour scale used depends on the type of variable selected.

## Categorical colour-coding

When a **categorical** (factor) variable is selected, each level of the variable is assigned a distinct colour. This is useful for identifying group membership and comparing patterns across groups.

- Each category gets a unique colour from the default palette
- A legend is displayed showing which colour maps to which category
- Works with all plot types: scatter plots, dot plots, histograms, and bar charts
- For bar charts, colour-by produces [segmented bar charts](/docs/graphics/graph-types/bar)

## Continuous colour-coding

When a **numeric** variable is selected, a continuous colour gradient is used. This helps reveal how the values of a third numeric variable relate to the two variables already being plotted.

- Points are coloured along a gradient from low to high values
- The default gradient uses the **viridis** palette, which is designed to be perceptually uniform and colourblind-friendly
- A colour bar legend shows the mapping from values to colours
- You can switch between **linear** and **rank** colour methods — rank colouring assigns colours based on the order of values rather than their magnitude, which can be useful when data are skewed

## Colour palettes

iNZight uses a default palette that is designed to be accessible. For categorical variables with up to 10 levels, distinct colours are used. For more levels, the **viridis** palette is used to ensure readability.

You can change the colour palette if a custom function or named palette is preferred.

Combining colour with [shape](/docs/graphics/plot-features/shape) is a good strategy for ensuring plots are accessible to people with colour vision deficiencies.

## Colour emphasis

When exploring a particular group, you can **emphasise** one level of the colour-by variable. This highlights the selected group while fading the others, making it easier to trace patterns for a single group within the full dataset.
