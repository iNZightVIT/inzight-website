title: Identify Points
description: Label and identify specific points in your plots.

import { Desktop, Lite } from "@site/src/components/VersionToggle/inzVersion";

The **Identify Points** options in **Add to Plot** allow you to label, colour, and highlight specific points of interest in your plots. This is useful for investigating outliers, highlighting specific observations, or adding context to your visualisations.

The identify panel has two parts: choosing **how to label** identified points, and choosing **how to select** them.

## How to label points

- **Text labels**: Select a variable from the dataset to label identified points. The label text appears next to each point — typically a name, ID, or category. When no label variable is selected, row numbers are shown instead.
- **Colour points**: Fill identified points with a chosen colour to make them stand out from the rest of the data (default: **red**). Identified points are drawn as solid filled symbols for emphasis.
- **With the same level of**: Highlight all observations that share the same level of a grouping variable as the identified points. For example, in the Gapminder dataset you can identify a country in one year and track all observations of that country across time. The originally identified point is highlighted for reference.

## How to select points

<Desktop>

### Click to locate

You can click directly on the plot to identify the nearest point. The **Click to Locate** button puts the plot into an interactive mode — click on any point, and iNZight finds the closest observation and labels it. You can click multiple times to build up a set of identified points, and use the **Click to Remove** button to deselect individual points by clicking on them.

:::note Limitations

Click-to-locate is not available when:
- Multiple plots are displayed (e.g., when using subsetting variables with `_MULTI`)
- For dot plots, when Variable 2 is a categorical variable

### By value of a variable

Select a variable and a specific value to highlight all observations matching that value. For variables with a small number of unique values (or a factor), a slider is provided to quickly cycle through levels. For numeric variables or when you want to select multiple levels, you can click the **Select levels** button. This is useful for exploring how specific groups are distributed across the plot.

### By extreme values

Select the most **extreme points** automatically. For scatter plots, this uses [Mahalanobis distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahalanobis_distance) from the centre of the data, identifying points that are most unusual in terms of both their x and y values considered together. For dot plots, you can separately control how many points to identify from the lower and upper ends of the distribution using the **N Lower** and **N Upper** sliders.

### By range of values

Select a variable and use a slider to define a **range of values** to highlight. All observations with values within the chosen range are identified. This is useful for investigating a region of the data, such as all observations with heights between 160 and 180 cm.

Once identified, you can save the selection using the **Save these points** button if you want to retain the same observations across multiple plots.

## Applicable plot types

Point identification is available for **scatter plots** and **dot plots**, as these plot types display individual data points that can be labelled and highlighted.
