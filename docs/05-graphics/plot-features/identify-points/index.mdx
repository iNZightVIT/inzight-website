title: Identify Points
description: Label and identify specific points in your plots.

import { Desktop } from "@site/src/components/VersionToggle/inzVersion";

The **Identify Points** options in **Add to Plot** allow you to label, colour, and highlight specific points of interest in your plots. This is useful for investigating outliers, highlighting specific observations, or adding context to your visualisations.

## Labelling points

You can label points by selecting a variable to use as labels from the **Identify** dropdown. The label variable determines what text appears next to each identified point — typically a name, ID, or category.

When no label variable is selected but points are identified, row numbers are shown instead.

## Selection methods

iNZight provides several ways to choose which points to identify:

<Desktop>

### Click to locate

You can click directly on the plot to identify the nearest point. The **Click to Locate** button puts the plot into an interactive mode — click on any point, and iNZight finds the closest observation and labels it. You can click multiple times to build up a set of identified points, and use the **Click to Remove** button to deselect individual points by clicking on them.

:::note Limitations

Click-to-locate is not available when:
- Multiple plots are displayed (e.g., when using subsetting variables with `_MULTI`)
- For dot plots, when Variable 2 is a categorical variable

### By value of a variable

Select a variable and a specific value to highlight all observations matching that value. For variables with a small number of unique values, a slider is provided to quickly cycle through them. This is useful for exploring how specific groups are distributed across the plot.

### By extreme values

Select the most **extreme points** automatically. For scatter plots, this uses Mahalanobis distance from the centre of the data, identifying points that are most unusual in terms of both their x and y values considered together. For dot plots, you can separately control how many points to identify from the lower and upper ends of the distribution. You can control how many extreme points to identify (e.g., the top 5 or 10 most extreme).

### Same level identification

When identifying extreme points, you can also highlight all observations that share the same level of a grouping variable as the identified points. For example, if you identify an extreme point and it belongs to group "A", all points in group "A" can be highlighted together.

## Colouring identified points

Identified points can be drawn in a distinct colour (default: **red**) to make them stand out from the rest of the data. When combined with labels, this creates a clear visual emphasis on the points of interest.

## How it works

- Identified points are labelled with text from the selected variable
- Labels are positioned near their corresponding points
- Non-identified points remain in their default colour
- The identified points are drawn as solid filled points for emphasis

## Applicable plot types

Point identification is available for **scatter plots** and **dot plots**, as these plot types display individual data points that can be labelled and highlighted.
