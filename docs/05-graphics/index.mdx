description: A guide to iNZight's graphical capabilities.
---

The primary focus of iNZight is graphics, which make it ideal for explorative data analysis. In this section, we will cover the graphical capabilities of iNZight, including the various types of plots available and how you can modify them.

:::tip The Plot Toolbar

If you are not already familiar with it, you should read up on the [Plot Toolbar](/docs/interface/plot-toolbar) as the buttons within will be referenced heavily throughout this section.

The key icons to know are:

- **Add to Plot**
- **Remove Additions**
- **Inference Information**

which are found on the right-hand side of the toolbar (at the bottom of the window).

## Creating Graphs

As we [discussed in the Getting Started guide](/docs/getting-started/first-graphs), all of the graphics are driven by the [control panel](/docs/interface/control-panel). The control panel is where you select the variables you want to investigate, and the software will automatically display the appropriate graph.

The types of graph depends on the variable types. Below is an overview of the types of graphs available for each combination of variables in iNZight, with links to dedicated help pages.

import GraphTypes from "./GraphTypes";

<GraphTypes />

## Modifying Graphs

Once you have created a basic graph, iNZight provides a range of modification options in the **Add to Plot** panel, accessed from the plot toolbar (or the **Plot** menu).

The full list of available configurations are listed below with links to dedicated help pages.

:::tip Remove Additions

Some options apply to all graphs, while others are specific to the type of graph you have created. These settings are stored, so you can change the graph and chosen settings _that still apply_ will be preserved. However, occasionally this may result in unintended consequences, but you can easily clear modifications

- manually by going back to the relevant settings in **Add to Plot**
- by clicking the **Remove Additions** button on the plot toolbar and selecting the relevant options (or removing all, if you wish).
